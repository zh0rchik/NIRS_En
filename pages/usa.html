On the north, it borders Quebec, Can., on the south, Massachusetts, and on the west, New York. From the Canadian to the Massachusetts border, the Connecticut River separates Vermont from New Hampshire on the east.</p>
                                <p>Both the Dutch and the British established settlements in the 18th century, but the area fell exclusively to the British in 1763. In 1775, at the start of the American Revolution, Allen and his group, fighting for the colonies, captured Fort Ticonderoga from the British. Vermonters created an independent republic in 1777, and in 1791 it became the 14th U.S. state. In 1864, during the American Civil War, it was the site of the only action north of Pennsylvania when a band of Confederates raided St. Albans from Canada.</p>

In 1861, soon after the start of the American Civil War, Virginia seceded from the Union. Richmond became the capital of the Confederacy, and Virginia was the chief battleground throughout the war. The western part of the state refused to secede; it split off to become West Virginia in 1863. Virginia was readmitted to the Union in 1870.</p>

                            <g data-description="<p>Illinois, State, Midwestern U.S. Illinois is bordered by Wisconsin, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, and Iowa. The Mississippi River forms the state’s western boundary, the Ohio River and Wabash River form its southeastern border, and the Illinois River traverses the state. Lake Michigan lies to the northeast. Located on the northeastern border is Chicago, the country’s third largest city.</p>
                                <p>The French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet entered the territory in 1673. France controlled it until 1763, when it passed to Britain after the French and Indian War. It became part of the Northwest Territory in 1783 and part of Indiana Territory in 1800. Illinois Territory was formed in 1809. It became the 21st state in 1818. Although politically divided during the American Civil War, Illinois remained part of the Union. In the 20th century, intense party rivalry (between Republicans and Democrats) and the state’s large electoral vote made it a major battleground in presidential elections. It is one of the largest U.S. industrial centres and a top manufacturer of nonelectrical machinery. It is also a major insurance centre.</p>

Daniel Boone, among the first white settlers, arrived in 1769; a wave of immigration followed the American Revolution. Settlements began as part of a district of Virginia, but in 1792 Kentucky entered the Union as the 15th state. It was a border state during the American Civil War, remaining in the Union but providing troops to both sides. The opening of rail lines into the eastern coal country and the introduction of a tobacco economy spurred growth in the late 19th century.</p>

In 1861 it seceded from the Union; the hard-fought American Civil War battles of Shiloh, Chattanooga, Stones River, and Nashville occurred there. In 1866 it was the first state readmitted to the Union. </p>

                                <p>The area was inhabited by many Native American peoples when in 1792 Capt. Robert Gray explored the Columbia River, giving the U.S. a claim to the region. The river’s mouth was reached by the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805. The first white settlement was founded at Astoria in 1811 by the fur trader John J. Astor. Settlement of the area accelerated from 1843 with mass migration over the Oregon Trail. It was part of the Oregon Territory and was admitted to the Union as the 33rd state in 1859.</p>

Hudson’s Bay Co. traders were also interested in the same area, and Russian-Canadian trade rivalry lasted well into the 19th century. In 1867 William Seward negotiated Alaska’s sale from the Russians to the U.S., and the subsequent discovery of gold stimulated American settlement.

                                <p>At the beginning of the 19th century, Kamehameha I united the group under his rule. American whalers began to stop there; they were followed in 1820 by New England missionaries, and Western influences changed the islands. While Kamehameha III in 1851 placed Hawaii under U.S. protection, a coup fomented by U.S. sugar interests resulted in the monarchy’s overthrow and the establishment of a Republic of Hawaii (1893). In 1898 the new republic and the U.S. agreed on annexation, and in 1900 Hawaii became a U.S. territory. Hawaii became the 50th U.S. state on Aug. 21, 1959.</p>

Situated at the navigational head of the Potomac River, between Maryland and Virginia, it has an area of 68 sq mi (176 sq km). </p>
                                <p>The site was chosen by George Washington in 1790 as a political compromise that satisfied both Northern and Southern states. Designed by Pierre-Charles L’Enfant, it is one of the few cities in the world planned expressly as a national capital. The federal government occupied it in 1800. British troops burned the city (1814) during the War of 1812. With the annexation of Georgetown in 1871, the city became coterminous with the District of Columbia. Significant buildings include the Capitol, the White House, and the Library of Congress. The Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, and Vietnam Veterans Memorial are among the most famous of the city’s hundreds of memorials and statues.</p>

                                    The British Empire was the biggest empire in world history – and there’s a reason why its nickname was the 
                                    ‘empire on which the sun never sets’. It covered nearly a quarter of the world, dominating some twenty-three 
                                    percent of the world’s population and twenty-four percent of the surface of the planet (pic. 2).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    British imperial activity began in the late sixteenth centuryю. Elizabeth I began a policy of exploration in the Americas 
                                    and pursued naval conflicts with the Spanish. People like Walter Raleigh and Francis Drake (pic. 3) were engaged in piracy looting the spoils 
                                    of Spanish discoveries and trying to establish colonies of their own.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In contexts, such as India, where the native population was not destroyed by the colonists, 
                                    the imperial regime often used native upper classes to rule under the control of the British. 
                                    Mahatma Gandhi (pic. 4) is a legendary man, the father of the nation, a quiet and modest man who proved 
                                    to the whole world that the struggle for rights and justice can take place without aggression and bloodshed.
